Main Algorithem

start by placing on every n a hole (n must be a number that divides the memory length)
a hole is a code that creates more hole at n/2 intervals between every two holes (and recursivly continue)

after the main holes have been placed we can move to bombing them.

TODO:
- Figure out how the holes should look like and how can we copy them.
- How the bombing should be.
- What defensive techniques are we going to use?
